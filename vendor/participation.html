<h1>Vendor Participation</h1>

<p>If you are a vendor and wish to participate in the upcoming TPF Users Group Conference, please consider the following:</p>

<ul>
     <li>Registered vendor representatives are entitled to participate in a variety of ways at the TPF Users Group conferences.  As part of your registration, you can (within the guidelines below):
          <ul>
               <li>Attend all conference functions, sessions and meetings.</li>
               <li>Attend all conference meal and evening functions</li>
               <li>Make presentations in subcommittee meetings</li>
               <li>Host a hospitality suite or exhibition area.</li>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Only registered vendor representatives may attend conference sessions (general session, subcommittee, hot topic).  Occasionally, a specific session may be closed (members only).  If a session is closed, vendors are not permitted to attend.   This information will be posted in advance in the agenda (printed and web site) and on-site at the conference.</li>
     <li>Vendor presentation requests should come from the subcommittee chairperson(s) appropriate to the subject and adhere to the following guidelines:
          <ul>
               <li>Presentations must stay within their allotted time slot, so all scheduled activities can be accomplished as planned.  Presenters overrunning their allotted time will be asked to stop their presentation.</li>
               <li>Many of the participants speak English as a second language. Presenters should speak clearly and slowly.</li>
               <li>All presentations are intended to be a technical exchange of information with the meeting participants.  Marketing or promotion of products or services are not permitted.</li>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Hospitality suites are available for individual vendor functions.   The vendor pays for all costs (food, beverage, A/V, setup, etc.)  Room sizes vary depending on meeting space availability.  All vendor functions usually occur on Monday evening of the conference.  Contact Really Great Meetings for details and to make arrangements.</li>
     <li>Exhibition area is available for shared vendor functions.  All expenses are shared among the vendors (food, beverage, A/V, setup, etc.).  Generally, a 12x12 booth-type setup is available.  Other sizes are also available.  The vendor exhibition function occurs on Monday evening of the conference.  Contact Really Great Meetings for details and to make arrangements.</li>
     <li>Vendors now have a representative on the Board of Directors of the TPF Users Group.  Suggestions, complaints or other issues that should be addressed by the Board, should be submitted through your vendor representative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vendors that do not adhere to the above guidelines may be asked to leave the conference and their participation in future conferences restricted.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.<br><em>The TPF Users Group Board of Directors</em></p>
