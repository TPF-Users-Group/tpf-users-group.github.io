<h1>What is TPF?</h1>

<p>If you ended up here, you're either an old pro at TPF and wanted to keep us honest, or you've never heard of TPF and would like to know a little more.</p>

<p>Well, TPF stands for Transaction Processing Facility. It's a specialized operating system developed and marketed by International Business Machines Corporation, out of the IBM Poughkeepsie, NY development lab. The latest version is z/TPF EE 1.1 and is a high-performance operating system specifically designed to provide high availability for demanding high volume, real-time transaction processing for mission critical e-business applications.</p>

<p>z/TPF runs on and exploits IBM's zSeries servers, an infrastructure offering for transaction processing with high service demands.  As the next generation of on-demand transaction processing systems, z/TPF has been developed on the architecture of previous TPF 4.1 release.</p>

<p>TPF 4.1 and now z/TPF are widely used in Travel, Banking/Finance, and Public Sector industries and is well suited to business computing environments requiring High Availability, fast response times, low cost per transaction with an open development Linux based environment and a flexible cost structure.</p>

<p>Some of the larger z/TPF users run tens of thousands of transactions per second while providing sub-second response times to their customers.   Check out who some of our <a href="#">members</a> are.</p>
