<h2>{Excerpt from the Bylaws of the TPFUG)</h2>

<p><a href="/background/officers.html" class="btn btn-default" role="button">Return to officers</a></p>

<p>The business, affairs, activities, and property of the TPFUG are managed, directed, governed, and controlled, and the powers of the TPFUG are vested in and exercised by the Board of Directors composed of a number of not less than six (6) nor more than thirteen (13) members. Directors must be employees or other representatives of companies that are Members of the TPFUG; however, no director may be employed by, or represent, a Member company which is already represented on the Board, except as noted below.  All directors shall be natural persons of the age of eighteen (18) years or older, but directors need not be residents of the United States.  No compensation is paid to directors for their services or for performance of their duties.</p>

<p>Within the Board, two (2) positions will be reserved for representatives, whom are employed by and will represent the <strong>IBM Corporation</strong>.  If one or more of these positions are not filled by IBM, they will remain unfilled on the board or otherwise open and available till such time that IBM nominates a person(s) to fill the vacant position(s).</p>

<p>Furthermore, one (1) position will be reserved for a representative from the <strong>Vendors</strong> that are members of the TPFUG.  It is at the sole discretion of the Vendor community to select a representative to be nominated to the Board, from within their ranks.  The method for selection of the nominee is solely up to the vendor community.  If this position is not filled, then this position will remain unfilled on the Board or otherwise open and available till such time that the vendor community nominates a person to fill that position.</p>

<p>A Member company (Member, Vendor or IBM) desiring to place an employee or other representative on the Board shall apply to the Chairperson of the Board by written application, via e-mail, fax or postal mail.  The Chairperson shall then place the application before the board for vote.  The Board shall then determine whether there are any vacancies on the Board.  If so, the Board shall vote on the application.</p>

<p>Directors shall be elected from the persons nominated upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the entire Board. The term of office of any newly elected director shall commence immediately upon adjournment of the meeting at which he or she was elected and will be notified by the board of the outcome of the election.</p>

<hr>

<p>A board member usually spends on average one to three hours per month on activities related to the TPF Users Group, although most of that time is consumed immediately before and after the Spring and Fall conferences.  The TPFUG usually tries to schedule these conferences in the months of April and October, based on holidays and availability of conference facilities.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Board allows up to two (2) representatives from <strong>IBM</strong> and up to one (1) representative from the <strong>vendor</strong> community as consultants to the board.  These consultants (along with other consultants such as legal and financial councils) may participate in all activities of the board but have no voting rights.</p>

<p>If your member company wishes to place a representative on the board please contact the Chairperson or any Board representative and submit your nomination.</p>
