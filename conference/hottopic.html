<h1>Hot Topic Sessions</h1>

<p>Hot Topics are sessions of current interest to specific members.  Hot Topics are added during the course of a conference and generally meet following the main conference sessions of each day (Monday and Tuesday).   These sessions are usually informal meetings where individuals with similar interests can get together to discuss a specific topic in more detail. </p>

<p>Any conference attendee may request a hot topic. Hot topics can also be requested in advance through the Hot Topics coordinator or through the Board of Directors. Any requests for audio/visual equipment should be made through Really Great Meetings via the A/V form. During the conference a Hot Topics sheet is posted on the message board, where anyone can request a Hot Topic.</p>

<p>A Vendor requesting a Hot Topic session may not put their OWN products or services as an item to be discussed or otherwise use a Hot Topic session to showcase their OWN products or services. A Member company may request a Hot Topic session focused on a vendor's product or service (including IBM products and services) when the intention is to share user experience or discuss problems related to use of the product or service.</p>

<p>Hot Topics are generally only scheduled for Monday and Tuesday after the day's normal agenda is completed.  There is no guarantee that every Hot Topic requested will be held. If there are more Hot Topics requested than available meeting space, then a show of hands at the last general session (or Subcommittee meetings) will be taken and the top Hot Topic sessions will be selected to meet on that day, to the capacity of available meeting space. Those Hot Topics that cannot be accommodated on that day will be moved to the following day. Hot Topic sessions having special A/V requirements or participation limitations (e.g. guest speaker is only available for a specific day) will be given special consideration when voting.</p>

<p>The individual(s) requesting a hot topic becomes the chairperson(s) of that Hot Topic. The chairperson(s) are responsible for:</p>
<ul>
     <li>Leading the meeting. The opening should include a description of why the session was requested, what they hope to discuss and achieve during the session.</li>
     <li>Requesting A/V equipment if needed.</li>
     <li>Taking attendance for the official conference minutes. Name, Organization, e-mail (if appropriate)</li>
     <li>Meeting minutes are encouraged for inclusion in the conference minutes. Chairperson or designate is responsible for minutes if they are taken. A copy of the attendance sheet, any minutes or presentations (soft copy or hard) should be forwarded to the Minutes Coordinator or submitted to the conference registration area personnel.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Board of Directors will designate one or more Hot Topic Coordinators, who will assist and facilitate the organization of the Hot Topic sessions on each day of the conference. The Hot Topic Coordinator(s) will (a) assist the chairperson(s) of each Hot Topic session in securing A/V equipment (if necessary), (b) conduct the voting for Hot Topics if necessary due to meeting space limitations, and (c) be responsible for policing the sessions and may, in their sole judgment remove a Hot Topic request from the sign-up board, if such a session does not adhere to the above guidelines.   Please refer to the current <a href="/background/officers.html">Officers and Subcommittee list</a> for the currently assigned Hot Topic Coordinator(s).</p>
