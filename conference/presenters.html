<h1> For Presenters Only </h1>

<p>If you are a presenter at an upcoming TPF Users Group Conference, here are some guidelines we request you consider in making your presentation: </p>

<p>To ensure your equipment needs are satisfied, please submit an <a href="/conference/audiovisual.html">Audio/Visual Request Form</a>.  Or your chairperson may submit a form for you.  Please check with or coordinate with the chairperson of the subcommittee (if applicable).</p>

<ul>
     <li>Please allow enough time for questions at the end.   For example, if you have 30 minutes total, please plan 20 minutes for your presentation and 10 minutes for questions and answers.</li>
     <li>Many of the participants speak English as a second language.  So please speak clearly and slowly.</li>
     <li>Standard equipment is available in the General and Subcommittee sessions only.  Equipment is not normally available in the Task force or Hot Topic sessions, except by special request on an <a href="/conference/audiovisual.html"> Audio/Visual Request Form</a>.   Standard equipment includes:
          <ul>
               <li>Large screen projection system; SVGA (Sony or similar).</li>
               <li>Color Thinkpad or Toshiba portable PC attached to projector.</li>
               <li>Microsoft Windows 2000 and Microsoft (Office) Powerpoint Version 2000.</li>
               <li>Podium with fixed and clip-on microphones.</li>
               <li>If bringing your own PC, the projector provides a DB15-pin computer interface connection. </li>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Limited (and expensive) copying facilities are available at the hotel.  Whenever possible, please bring enough handouts for the audience.  Usually you can expect 250 for a general session, 100 for a subcommittee.</li>
     <li>Please provide a soft copy of your presentation to the subcommittee chairperson or designated TPFUG Conference Minutes coordinator, for inclusion in the minutes and in the Member section of the web site.</li>
     <li>You can submit your presentation or a synopsis in advance of the conference for inclusion on the web site.  If you have any questions or to send advanced materials,  please contact the Minutes Coordinator.</li>
     <li>All presentations whether from members, IBM or suppliers are intended to be a technical exchange of information with the membership.   Marketing or promotion of products or services should not be included in such a presentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for you cooperation. <br> The TPF Users Group Board of Directors</p>
